This is an introduction to react technology. I had to make a functional todo list with the help of tutorials and documentation.

### Functionalities

-   Save todo in local storage
-   add
-   delete
-   edit
-   sort by complete/uncomplete/all

    <img src="./src/img/todo.png" width="600px">

-   SASS

## What else should i do ?
